# Patient-Tracker 
The project's fundamental goal is to transform and digitize the patient tracking process within the healthcare management system. In doing so, it seeks to achieve a dual purpose: enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery while eliminating the cumbersome aspects of traditional manual record-keeping.
By creating a digital ecosystem that centralizes patient data and history, this project endeavors to provide healthcare professionals with a modern and streamlined solution. The core objective is to replace antiquated paper-based records with a secure and accessible digital platform that caters to the specific requirements of a wide range of healthcare stakeholders.
